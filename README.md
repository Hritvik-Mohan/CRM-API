# CRM Application API

This is the documentation for the API of our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application. The API allows developers to interact with the CRM application and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customers.

The API is designed to be RESTful, meaning that it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. All responses are returned in JSON format.
